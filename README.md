## Abstract

We applied the economic complexity framework pioneered by Hidalgo et al. in [1] to analyze the employment and economic units within Mexico's territorial boundaries, segmented by states and regions. We developed a machine learning approach to predict product development within the product space and gauge the significance of each complexity feature. Our analysis revealed that complexity metrics serve as significant predictors for economic activities development across the majority of states and regions.

## Data
We used the data found in (INEGI, ENOE?). This data contains the number of employees and economic units of each economic activity (EA) and service (registered at INEGI) in each state for the years: 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2019. The products and services are labeled according to the NAICS-SCIAN classification. The 32 states are arranged in 4 regions according to their geographical location, as follows:
-South: Campeche, Chiapas, Guerrero, Oaxaca, Quintana Roo, Tabasco, Veracruz y Yucatán.
-Center: Ciudad de México, Estado de México, Guanajuato, Hidalgo, Morelos, Puebla, Querétaro y Tlaxcala.
-Center-North: Aguascalientes, Baja California Sur, Colima, Durango, Jalisco, Michoacán, Nayarit, San Luis Potosí, Sinaloa.
-North: Baja California, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, Sonora, Tamaulipas y Zacatecas.
The overall sector distributions of the number of employees and economic units per year in each region are shown in the following figures.
